# Jinho Ko

**Greetings!** :star_struck:	

I am a senior student mainly studying computer science in POSTECH.

My research/development interest primarily lies in all kinds of **big data systems**, including database systems and distributed systems. I believe introducing deep learning into these systems will let them behave much smarter. I'm also interested in a wide range of data-driven technologies(along with its own system) such as knowledge base(+NLP) and automated stock trading systems that may bring revolutionary business insights. 

Details about my academic career are listed in my [academic website](http://academics.jinhoko.com/).  
I'm also running a [personal blog](http://blog.jinhoko.com/) where I occasionally write thoughts on technologies, books, and other stuff.
