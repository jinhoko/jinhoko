# Jinho Ko

**Greetings!** :star_struck:	

I am a first-year PhD student at Data Systems Lab at POSTECH. My research/development interests primarily lie in all kinds of **big data systems** including database systems and distributed systems. I'm also interested in a wide range of data-driven technologies (along with its own system) such as knowledge graphs that may bring revolutionary business insights.

Details about my academic career are listed in my [academic website](http://academics.jinhoko.com/).  
I'm also running a [personal blog](http://blog.jinhoko.com/) where I occasionally write thoughts on technologies, books, and other stuff.
